This folder contains three files containing various types of coding in 
PL/SQL which include:
*creating and using triggers
*creating and using cursors
*using loops and other conditional features to check and manipulate data
*populating databases automatically or conditionally

It also contains two SQL files containing the DDL for a movie database. The first is a MySQL draft and the second is the same database converted into Oracle SQL and extended to reflect new additions. This will form a final, large-scale, SQL project.
