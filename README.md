This folder contains three files containing various types of coding in 
PL/SQL which include:
*creating and using triggers
*creating and using cursors
*using loops and other conditional features to check and manipulate data
*populating databases automatically or conditionally

It also contains two SQL files containing the DDL for a movie database. The first is a MySQL draft and the second is the same database converted into Oracle SQL and extended to reflect new additions. This will form a final, large-scale, SQL project.

Another file has been added which contains the procedures, functions and queries which could be run on this DB. As well as some sample triggers which operate both before and after certain data insertion.
